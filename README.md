# Employee Records Project

## About
This was an app that I built to learn ASP.net CORE MVC framework using Visual Studio.
The goal was to create an employee records application that includes the following:

- ASP.NET MVC Web Application built in VS.
- Utilization of JQuery and AJAX.
- SQL database with an [Employee] table and logical fields (Name, Email, Phone, DateOfBirth, Address).
- Responsive design without use of Bootstrap template.
- HTML/CSS built from scratch.

That application was deployed with Microsoft Azure and can be viewed here:
